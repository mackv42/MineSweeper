# MineSweeper
Clone of Minesweeper written in .Net Core web API and javascript
Simple first version in javascript and .net core web api.
Tried to keep as simple as possible. an issue with this branch is that people can cheat by looking at what's going over the network
because all of the board data is sent to the client
